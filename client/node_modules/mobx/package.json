Automatically._\n\nwhich includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc.\n\n<img alt=\"MobX unidirectional flow\" src=\"docs/flow.png\" align=\"center\" />\n\nReact and MobX together are a powerful combination. React renders the application state by providing mechanisms to translate it into a tree of renderable components. MobX provides the mechanism to store and update the application state that React then uses.\n\nBoth React and MobX provide very optimal and unique solutions to common problems in application development. React provides mechanisms to optimally render UI by using a virtual DOM that reduces the number of costly DOM mutations. MobX provides mechanisms to optimally synchronize application state with your React components by using a reactive virtual dependency state graph that is only updated when strictly needed and is never stale.\n\n## Core concepts\n\nMobX has only a few core concepts. The following snippets can be tried online using [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mweststrate/wv3yopo0/) (or [without ES6 and JSX](https://jsfiddle.net/rubyred/55oc981v/)).\n\n### Observable state\n\nMobX adds observable capabilities to existing data structures like objects, arrays and class instances. This can simply be done by annotating your class properties with the [@observable](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/observable-decorator.html) decorator (ES.Next), or by invoking the [`observable`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/observable.html) or [`extendObservable`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/extend-observable.html) functions (ES5). See [Language support](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/wiki/Language-Support) for language-specific examples.\n\n```javascript\n// ESNext class example:\nclass Todo {\n    id = Math.random();\n    @observable title = \"\";\n    @observable finished = false;\n}\n\n// ES5 constructor function example:\nfunction Todo() {\n\tthis.id = Math.random()\n\textendObservable(this, {\n\t\ttitle: \"\",\n\t\tfinished: false\n\t})\n}\n\n// ... or just create plain objects:\nfunction createTodo() {\n\treturn observable({\n\t\tid: Math.random(),\n\t\ttitle: \"\",\n\t\tfinished: false\n\t})\n}\n\n```\n\nUsing `@observable` is like turning a value into a spreadsheet cell. But unlike spreadsheets, not only can these values be primitive values, but references, objects and arrays as well. You can even [define your own](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/extending.html) observable data sources.\n\n### Computed values\n\nWith MobX you can define values that will be derived automatically when relevant data is modified. By using the [`@computed`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/computed-decorator.html) decorator or by using parameterless functions as property values in `extendObservable`.\n\n```javascript\n// ESNext class example:\nclass TodoList {\n    @observable todos = [];\n    @computed get unfinishedTodoCount() {\n        return this.todos.filter(todo => !todo.finished).length;\n    }\n}\n\n// ES5 constructor function example:\nfunction TodoList() {\n\textendObservable(this, {\n\t\ttodos: [],\n\t\tunfinishedTodoCount: function() {\n\t        return this.todos.filter(function (todo) {\n\t\t\t\treturn !todo.finished\n\t\t\t}).length;\n\t\t}\n\t})\n}\n```\nMobX will ensure that `unfinishedTodoCount` is updated automatically when a todo is added or when one of the `finished` properties is modified.\nComputations like these can very well be compared with formulas in spreadsheet programs like MS Excel. They update automatically whenever, and only when, needed.\n\n### Reactions\n\nReactions are similar to a computed value, but instead of producing a new value, a reaction produces a side effect for things like printing to the console, making network requests, incrementally updating the React component tree to patch the DOM, etc.\nIn short, reactions bridge [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) and [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) programming.\n\nIf you are using React, you can turn your (stateless function) components into reactive components by simply adding the [`@observer`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/observer-component.html) decorator from the `mobx-react` package onto them.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport {observer} from \"mobx-react\";\n\n// ESNext decorator / JSX\n@observer\nclass TodoListView extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return <div>\n            <ul>\n                {this.props.todoList.todos.map(todo =>\n                    <TodoView todo={todo} key={todo.id} />\n                )}\n            </ul>\n            Tasks left: {this.props.todoList.unfinishedTodoCount}\n        </div>\n    }\n}\n\nconst TodoView = observer(({todo}) =>\n    <li>\n        <input\n            type=\"checkbox\"\n            checked={todo.finished}\n            onClick={() => todo.finished = !todo.finished}\n        />{todo.title}\n    </li>\n);\n\nconst store = new TodoList();\nReactDOM.render(<TodoListView todoList={store} />, document.getElementById('mount'));\n```\n\nIn ES5 a component declaration looks like this:\n```javascript\nvar TodoListView = observer(React.createClass({ /* etc */ }))\n```\n\n`observer` turns React (function) components into derivations of the data they render.\n\nAlso, reactions can be created using the [`autorun`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/autorun.html), [`autorunAsync`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/autorun-async.html) or [`when`](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/when.html) functions to fit your specific situations.\n\nWhen using MobX there are no smart or dumb components.\n\nAll components render smartly but are defined in a dumb manner. MobX will simply make sure the components are always re-rendered whenever needed, but also no more than that. So the `onClick` handler in the above example will force the proper `TodoView` to render, and it will cause the `TodoListView` to render if the number of unfinished tasks has changed.\n\nHowever, if you would remove the `Tasks left` line (or put it into a separate component), the `TodoListView` will no longer re-render when ticking a box. You can verify this yourself by changing the [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mweststrate/wv3yopo0/).\n\nFor an in-depth explanation about how MobX determines to which observables needs to be reacted, check out: [Understanding what MobX reacts to](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/gh-pages/docs/best/react.md)\n\n### Actions\n\nUnlike many flux frameworks, MobX is unopinionated about how user events should be handled.\n\n* This can be done in a Flux like manner.\n* Or by processing events using RxJS.\n* Or by simply handling events in the most straightforward way possible, as demonstrated in the above `onClick` handler.\n\nIn the end it all boils down to: Somehow the state should be updated.\n\nAfter updating the state `MobX` will take care of the rest in an efficient, glitch-free manner. So simple statements, like below, are enough to automatically update the user interface.\n\nThere is no technical need for firing events, calling dispatcher or what more. A React component is in the end nothing more than a fancy representation of your state. A derivation that will be managed by MobX.\n\n```javascript\nstore.todos.push(\n    new Todo(\"Get Coffee\"),\n    new Todo(\"Write simpler code\")\n);\nstore.todos[0].finished = true;\n```\n\nNonetheless, MobX has an optional built-in concept of [`actions`](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/action.html).\nUse them to your advantage; they will help you to structure your code better and make wise decisions about when and where state should be modified.\n\n## MobX: Simple and scalable\n\nMobX is one of the least obtrusive libraries you can use for state management. That makes the `MobX` approach not just simple, but very scalable as well:\n\n### Using classes and real references\n\nWith MobX you don't need to normalize your data. This makes the library very suitable for very complex domain models (At Mendix for example ~500 different domain classes in a single application).\n\n### Referential integrity is guaranteed\n\nSince data doesn't need to be normalized, and MobX automatically tracks the relations between state and derivations, you get referential integrity for free. Rendering something that is accessed through three levels of indirection?\n\nNo problem, MobX will track them and re-render whenever one of the references changes. As a result staleness bugs are a thing of the past. As a programmer you might forget that changing some data might influence a seemingly unrelated component in a corner case. MobX won't forget.\n\n### Simpler actions are easier to maintain\n\nAs demonstrated above, modifying state when using MobX is very straightforward. You simply write down your intentions. MobX will take care of the rest.\n\n### Fine grained observability is efficient\n\nMobX builds a graph of all the derivations in your application to find the least number of re-computations that is needed to prevent staleness. \"Derive everything\" might sound expensive, MobX builds a virtual derivation graph to minimize the number of recomputations needed to keep derivations in sync with the state.\n\nIn fact, when testing MobX at Mendix we found out that using this library to track the relations in our code is often a lot more efficient then pushing changes through our application by using handwritten events or \"smart\" selector based container components.\n\nThe simple reason is that MobX will establish far more fine grained 'listeners' on your data then you would do as a programmer.\n\nSecondly MobX sees the causality between derivations so it can order them in such a way that no derivation has to run twice or introduces a glitch.\n\nHow that works? See this [in-depth explanation of MobX](https://medium.com/@mweststrate/becoming-fully-reactive-an-in-depth-explanation-of-mobservable-55995262a254).\n\n### Easy interoperability\n\nMobX works plain javascript structures. Due to it's unobtrusiveness it works with most javascript libraries out of the box, without needing MobX specific library flavors.\n\nSo you can simple keep using your existing router-, data fetching and utility libraries like `react-router`, `director`, `superagent`, `lodash` etc.\n\nFor the same reason you can use it out of the box both server- and client side, in isomorphic applications and with react-native.\n\nThe result of this is that you often need to learn less new concepts when using MobX in comparison to other state management solutions.\n\n---\n\n\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://www.mendix.com/styleguide/img/logo-mendix.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"200\"/>\n\n__MobX is proudly used in mission critical systems at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com)__\n</center>\n\n## Credits\n\nMobX is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in spreadsheets. It is inspired by MVVM frameworks like in MeteorJS tracker, knockout and Vue.js. But MobX brings Transparent Functional Reactive Programming to the next level and provides a stand alone implementation. It implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient manner.\n\nA ton of credits for [Mendix](https://github.com/mendix), for providing the flexibility and support to maintain MobX and the chance to proof the philosophy of MobX in a real, complex, performance critical applications.\n\nAnd finally kudo's for all the people that believed in, tried and validated MobX.\n\n## Further resources and documentation\n\n* [MobX homepage](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/faq/blogs.html)\n* [API overview](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/api.html)\n* [Tutorials, Blogs & Videos](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/faq/blogs.html)\n* [Boilerplates](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/faq/boilerplates.html)\n* [Related projects](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/faq/related.html)\n\n\n## What others are saying...\n\n> After using #mobx for lone projects for a few weeks, it feels awesome to introduce it to the team. Time: 1/2, Fun: 2X\n\n> Working with #mobx is basically a continuous loop of me going “this is way too simple, it definitely won’t work” only to be proven wrong\n\n> Try react-mobx with es6 and you will love it so much that you will hug someone.\n\n> I have built big apps with MobX already and comparing to the one before that which was using Redux, it is simpler to read and much easier to reason about.\n\n> The #mobx is the way I always want things to be! It's really surprising simple and fast! Totally awesome! Don't miss it!\n\n## Contributing\n\n* Feel free to send small pull requests. Please discuss new features or big changes in a GitHub issue first.\n* Use `npm test` to run the basic test suite, `npm run coverage` for the test suite with coverage and `npm run perf` for the performance tests.\n\n## Enabling decorators (optional)\n\n**TypeScript**\n\nEnable the compiler option `experimentalDecorators` in `tsconfig.json` or pass it as flag `--experimentalDecorators` to the compiler.\n\n**Babel:**\n\nInstall support for decorators: `npm i --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy`. And enable it in your `babelrc` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"es2015\",\n    \"stage-1\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-decorators-legacy\"]\n}\n```\nProbably you have more plugins and presets in your `.babelrc` already, note that the order is important and `transform-decorators-legacy` should come as first.\n\n## Bower support\n\nBower support is available through the infamous npmcdn.com:\n`bower install https://npmcdn.com/mobx/bower.zip`\n\nThen use `lib/mobx.umd.js` or `lib/mobx.umd.min.js`\n\n## MobX was formerly known as Mobservable.\n\nSee the [changelog](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200) for all the details about `mobservable` to `mobx`.\n\n## Donating\n\nWas MobX key in making your project a success?
