This is highly specific to React internals and probably (a) hacky and (b) not useful to other packages, so it has been left out. Please open an issue with your thoughts if you disagree or have a better idea.\n\n## Why?\n\nA number of packages and components use React's private ExecutionEnvironment lib to detect available features, particularly to detect server-side rendering, e.g\n\n```\ncanUseDOM = require('react/lib/ExecutionEnvironment').canUseDOM; // BAD\n```\n\n**It is bad practice to use React internals** and this is likely to be broken / disabled in the future.\n\nUse this package instead!\n",
