  "readme": "# cosmiconfig\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/master.svg?label=unix%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/master.svg?label=windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/branch/master)\n\nFind and load a configuration object from\n- a `package.json` property (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a JSON or YAML \"rc file\" (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a `.config.js` CommonJS module (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a CLI `--config` argument\n\nFor example, if your module's name is \"soursocks,\" cosmiconfig will search out configuration in the following places:\n- a `soursocks` property in `package.json` (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a `.soursocksrc` file in JSON or YAML format (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a `soursocks.config.js` file exporting a JS object (anywhere down the file tree)\n- a CLI `--config` argument\n\ncosmiconfig continues to search in these places all the way down the file tree until it finds acceptable configuration (or hits the home directory). And it does all this asynchronously, so it shouldn't get in your way.\n\nAdditionally, all of these search locations are configurable: you can customize filenames or turn off any location.\n\nYou can also look for rc files with extensions, e.g. `.soursocksrc.json` or `.soursocksrc.yaml`.\nYou may like extensions on your rc files because you'll get syntax highlighting and linting in text editors.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install cosmiconfig\n```\n\nTested in Node 0.10+.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar cosmiconfig = require('cosmiconfig');\n\ncosmiconfig(yourModuleName[, options])\n  .then(function(result) {\n    // result.config is the parsed configuration object\n    // result.filepath is the path to the config file that was found\n  })\n  .catch(function(parsingError) {\n    // do something constructive\n  });\n```\n\nThe function `cosmiconfig()` searches for a configuration object and returns a Promise,\nwhich resolves with an object containing the information you're looking for.\n\nSo let's say `var yourModuleName = 'goldengrahams'` — here's how cosmiconfig will work:\n\n- Starting from `process.cwd()` (or some other directory defined by `options.cwd`), it looks for configuration objects in three places, in this order:\n  1. A `goldengrahams` property in a `package.json` file (or some other property defined by `options.packageProp`);\n  2. A `.goldengrahamsrc` file with JSON or YAML syntax (or some other filename defined by `options.rc`);\n  3. A `goldengrahams.config.js` JS file exporting the object (or some other filename defined by `options.js`).\n- If none of those searches reveal a configuration object, it moves down one directory and tries again. So the search continues in `./`, `../`, `../../`, `../../../`, etc., checking those three locations in each directory.\n- It continues searching until it arrives at your home directory (or some other directory defined by `options.stopDir`).\n- If at any point a parseable configuration is found, the `cosmiconfig()` Promise resolves with its result object.\n- If no configuration object is found, the `cosmiconfig()` Promise resolves with `null`.\n- If a configuration object is found *but is malformed* (causing a parsing error), the `cosmiconfig()` Promise rejects and shares that error (so you should `.catch()` it).\n\nAll this searching can be short-circuited by passing `options.configPath` or a `--config` CLI argument to specify a file.\ncosmiconfig will read that file and try parsing it as JSON, YAML, or JS.\n\n## API\n\n### cosmiconfig(moduleName[, options])\n\nReturns a promise that resolves with `null` (if no configuration was found) or an object with the following properties:\n\n- **config**: The parsed configuration object that was found.\n- **filepath**: The path to the file that housed that configuration object.\n\n#### moduleName\n\nType: `string`\n\nYou module name. This is used to create the default filenames that cosmiconfig will look for.\n\n#### Options\n\n##### packageProp\n\nType: `string` or `false`\nDefault: `'[moduleName]'`\n\nName of the property in `package.json` to look for.\n\nIf `false`, cosmiconfig will not look in `package.json` files.\n\n##### rc\n\nType: `string` or `false`\nDefault: `'.[moduleName]rc'`\n\nName of the \"rc file\" to look for, which can be formatted as JSON or YAML.\n\nIf `false`, cosmiconfig will not look for an rc file.\n\nIf `rcExtensions: true`, the rc file can also have extensions that specify the syntax, e.g. `.[moduleName]rc.json`.\nYou may like extensions on your rc files because you'll get syntax highlighting and linting in text editors.\nAlso, with `rcExtensions: true`, you can use JS modules as rc files, e.g. `.[moduleName]rc.js`.\n\n##### js\n\nType: `string` or `false`\nDefault: `'[moduleName].config.js'`\n\nName of a JS file to look for, which must export the configuration object.\n\nIf `false`, cosmiconfig will not look for a JS file.\n\n##### argv\n\nType: `string` or `false`\nDefault: `'config'`\n\nName of a `process.argv` argument to look for, whose value should be the path to a configuration file.\ncosmiconfig will read the file and try to parse it as JSON, YAML, or JS.\nBy default, cosmiconfig looks for `--config`.\n\nIf `false`, cosmiconfig will not look for any `process.argv` arguments.\n\n##### configPath\n\nType: `string`\n\nPath to a configuration file. cosmiconfig will read it and try to parse it as JSON, YAML, or JS.\n\nThis option can be set via the command line with `--config`.\n\n##### rcStrictJson\n\nType: `boolean`\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf `true`, cosmiconfig will expect rc files to be strict JSON. No YAML permitted, and no sloppy JSON.\n\nBy default, rc files are parsed with [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml), which is\nmore permissive with punctuation than standard strict JSON.\n\n##### rcExtensions\n\nType: `boolean`\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf `true`, cosmiconfig will look for rc files with extensions, in addition to rc files without.\n\nThis adds a few steps to the search process.\nInstead of *just* looking for `.goldengrahamsrc` (no extension), it will also look for the following, in this order:\n\n- `.goldengrahamsrc.json`\n- `.goldengrahamsrc.yaml`\n- `.goldengrahamsrc.yml`\n- `.goldengrahamsrc.js`\n\n##### cwd\n\nType: `string`\nDefault: `process.cwd()`\n\nDirectory to start the search from.\n\n##### stopDir\n\nType: `string`\nDefault: Absolute path to your home directory\n\nDirectory where the search will stop.\n\n## Differences from [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc)\n\n[rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) serves its focused purpose well. cosmiconfig differs in a few key ways — making it more useful for some projects, less useful for others:\n\n- Looks for configuration in some different places: in a `package.json` property, an rc file, a `.config.js` file, and rc files with extensions.\n- Built-in support for JSON, YAML, and CommonJS formats.\n- Stops at the first configuration found, instead of finding all that can be found down the filetree and merging them automatically.\n- Options.\n- Asynchronicity.\n\n## Contributing & Development\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
